# Regenerate the two "two countries example" wide-format teaching CSVs in
# inst/extdata/ from the reflavored global_tech_adoption dataset.
#
# These files are used by behdsbook-part-1's reshaping-data.qmd (and the
# tidy-data example in tidyverse.qmd) to teach pivot_longer / pivot_wider /
# separate_wider_delim. They were originally built from dslabs::gapminder's
# `fertility` and `life_expectancy` columns pulled from now-dead Google
# Spreadsheet URLs; they are now derived from global_tech_adoption instead:
#   fertility            -> avg_price_per_app_usd   (unchanged values)  -> `price`
#   life_expectancy      -> avg_daily_screen_time_hours (rescaled)      -> `screen_time`
#
# `price` is deliberately a single token and `screen_time` two tokens so the
# separate_wider_delim(too_many = "merge") lesson still has a "2 pieces vs
# 3 pieces" case to handle.
